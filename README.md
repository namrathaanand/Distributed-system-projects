# Distributed-Systems-Project

##Implementation of Distributed File Server
*	The implementation of Distributed File Server done in such a way that it supports multiple requests and in order to fulfil this requirement Threads needed to be executed. The software I wrote was capable of handling hands on pool of requests if run on suitable industry level hardware. The Distributed file Server has Download, Rename, Delete and Upload functionalities.

##Implementation of Totally ordered Multicast using Lamport’s Algorithm
*	Demonstration of Totally ordered Multicast using Lamport’s algorithm to display timing mechanism in Distributed system was designed in Java by me. This was quite challenging as all the acknowledgements were also needed to be considered in addition to all the multicast being multithreaded.

##Implementation of Distributed Locking Mechanism
*	The project was developed to be a standing proof of concept for Distributed Locking Mechanism persistence. I designed a decentralised algorithm to display Locking as starvation can be avoided. In order to give full justice to the request maker nodes, the request queue was formed so the nodes can be allotted the resource on basis of request arrival.

##Benchmarking Distributed system using Hibench, Hadoop & Spark 
*	As a part of coursework for Big data benchmarking Hibench needed to be set in Virtual Machine and then Large Scale Hadoop and Spark jobs needed to be performed for Benchmarking. I fulfilled the initial requirement and also developed Hadoop program which was the bonus feature in the Programming Assignment.
